# kotlin-speed-up-processing


## Demo to show different mechanism of how to speed up processing


1. case 1. Standard REST call.
> curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/process | jq .
2. case 2. Standard REST call with asyc processing
> curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/process-async | jq .
3. Process in parallel all heavy operations. It takes the max from all operations
> curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/process-kotlinx | jq .
4. Process in parallel with async
> curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/process-kotlinx-launch | jq .
5. Process operation via Spring Boot Event synchronously (default behavior)
> curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/process-event | jq .
6. Process operation via Spring Boot Event asynchronously (improved)
> curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/process-event-async | jq .


##  Why fast respond to REST calls in crucial? How it affected to performance?

### Fast response times in REST (Representational State Transfer) API calls are important for several reasons, and they 
have a significant impact on the overall performance and user experience of an application. Here are some reasons why fast response times are crucial and how they affect performance:

1. User Experience:
        Users expect quick and responsive applications. Slow API responses can lead to frustration and a poor user experience. When users interact with an application, they want immediate feedback.
1. Efficiency:
        Fast responses enable applications to complete tasks more quickly. This is essential for real-time applications, such as messaging or gaming, where delays can be highly disruptive.
1. Scalability:
        Fast API responses help improve the scalability of your application. When APIs respond quickly, the application can handle a larger number of concurrent users without performance degradation.
1. Network Efficiency:
        Fast responses reduce the amount of time and bandwidth required to complete API requests. This is especially important for mobile applications or users with limited network connectivity.
1. Third-Party Integrations:
        Many applications rely on third-party APIs and services. Slow responses from these external services can bottleneck your application's performance.
1.  SEO and Search Rankings:
        For web applications, search engines like Google consider page load times as a ranking factor. Slow API responses can negatively impact your site's search engine optimization (SEO) and visibility.
1. Resource Utilization:
1. User Retention:
        Slow response times can lead to user churn, where users abandon an application in favor of a faster alternative.

### To achieve fast response times in REST API calls, you can consider the following strategies:

1. Optimize Backend Code:
        Efficiently design and optimize your backend code to process requests quickly. Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to minimize processing time.

1. Caching:
        Implement caching mechanisms to store and serve frequently requested data, reducing the need for repeated processing.

1. Load Balancing:
        Distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure that no single server becomes a performance bottleneck.

1 .Asynchronous Processing:
        Use asynchronous programming techniques to handle long-running tasks without blocking the main API thread.

1. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):
        Utilize CDNs to cache and serve static assets, reducing latency for clients.

1. Database Optimization:
        Optimize database queries and indexing to minimize database response times.

1. Monitoring and Profiling:
        Continuously monitor your application's performance and use profiling tools to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

In summary, fast response times in REST API calls are crucial for providing a good user experience, improving application performance, and ensuring scalability. Slow responses can lead to user dissatisfaction, inefficient resource utilization, and a negative impact on your application's performance and reputation.
